<p>Predicting COVID-19 Spread Based on Country’s Metrics</p>
<h3>Datasets:</h3>

</ul>

<p>
  Country Dataset: Each datapoint is a country with about 50 features, including
  GDP, Population Density, Urban Population, etc.
</p>
<p>
  COVID-19 Dataset: Each row has a country and date, along with Covid statistics
  for that country/date. These statistics include new cases, deaths, and tests
</p>
<p>
  We will combine datasets based on the country key. We will also combine
  multiple rows of the Kaggle dataset to generate a dataset that records total
  cases per country over time (every 2 weeks). The ground truth is the true
  number of reported COVID cases per country.

<h3>Introduction/Background</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to understand how effective the different characteristics of
  countries around the world (e.g.total population, population density, GDP)
  affect the rate at which COVID-19 spreads around the corresponding country.
  Some models rely on user’s inputs such as local population, current status of
  infection, while others focus more on data reported by the World Health
  Organization and their government. In addition, there seems to be a lack of
  information around the handling of coronavirus. It is easy to say a certain
  place’s government handled coronavirus well because the cases are low, and
  another’s handled it poorly due to the high rate of infection. However, this
  approach lacks context, failing to take into account the differences in
  countries.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
  We are analyzing unique combinations of features of countries to approach this
  problem. We will also try multiple machine learning approaches and see what is
  most effective. We think this will be successful because we can be flexible in
  our model choice and the country features we choose to analyze. Potential
  supervised methods we want to test out include linear regression, LDA, and
  decision trees. There are concerns about the accuracy of data regarding the
  spread of COVID, with certain countries underreporting or undertesting, which
  could have implications on the data of our model. Therefore, if we are not
  clear about the potential limitations of our model, we run the risk of
  spreading misinformation. We will be using free libraries and methods to
  perform our analysis. So, it will not cost anything. Depending on the method
  we use to analyze, the time will vary. For unsupervised methods, we will use
  GMM to cluster the data and look for relationships between the countries. From
  this clustering, we plan on learning if clustered countries have a similar
  Covid-19 spread.
</p>

<h3>Pre-processing</h3>
<p>
  For pre-processing we will remove several features. Some features contain
  information already encoded in other features. For example, we have
  information on population, surface area, and population density. We can remove
  population density in this situation, as it is population/surface area. There
  are also variables we think will likely be irrelevant to our findings, such as
  forested area or number of endangered species, which we plan to remove.
  Lastly, our data is entirely numerical except for the region in which a
  country resides (e.g. southern asia) which we will represent using one-hot
  encoding.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
  We will use half the dataset to train the model, and then check for accuracy
  against the other half of the dataset on past data. We can also predict the
  future rate of COVID-19 spread and wait until the predicted date to compare
  the actual spread against our predicted value. Our goal is to be within 10% of
  the true value. For example, we can predict total COVID-19 cases for a certain
  country 1 week into the future, and then see what the true value is once that
  time comes.
</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to provide unbiased prediction of COVID-19 spread by using
  various parameters for a better understanding of how each country operates and
  to combat spread of COVID-19 based on the predicted trajectory.
