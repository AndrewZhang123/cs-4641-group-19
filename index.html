</ul>

<p>
  Country Dataset: Each datapoint is a country with about 50 features, including
  GDP, Population Density, Urban Population, etc.
</p>
<p>
  COVID-19 Dataset: Each row has a country and date, along with Covid statistics
  for that country/date. These statistics include new cases, deaths, and tests
</p>
<p>
  We will combine datasets based on the country key. We will also combine
  multiple rows of the Kaggle dataset to generate a dataset that records total
  cases per country over time (every 2 weeks). The ground truth is the true
  number of reported COVID cases per country.

<h2>Touchpoint 1: Project Proposal</h2>
<h3>Summary Figure</h3>
<img src="img/infographic.png" alt="Infographic" style="width: 75%" />

<h3>Introduction/Background</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to understand how effective the different characteristics of
  countries around the world (e.g.total population, population density, GDP)
  affect the rate at which COVID-19 spreads around the corresponding country.
  Some models rely on user’s inputs such as local population, current status of
  infection, while others focus more on data reported by the World Health
  Organization and their government. In addition, there seems to be a lack of
  information around the handling of coronavirus. It is easy to say a certain
  place’s government handled coronavirus well because the cases are low, and
  another’s handled it poorly due to the high rate of infection. However, this
  approach lacks context, failing to take into account the differences in
  countries.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
  We are analyzing unique combinations of features of countries to approach this
  problem. We will also try multiple machine learning approaches and see what is
  most effective. We think this will be successful because we can be flexible in
  our model choice and the country features we choose to analyze. Potential
  supervised methods we want to test out include linear regression, LDA, and
  decision trees. There are concerns about the accuracy of data regarding the
  spread of COVID, with certain countries underreporting or undertesting, which
  could have implications on the data of our model. Therefore, if we are not
  clear about the potential limitations of our model, we run the risk of
  spreading misinformation. We will be using free libraries and methods to
  perform our analysis. So, it will not cost anything. Depending on the method
  we use to analyze, the time will vary. For unsupervised methods, we will use
  GMM to cluster the data and look for relationships between the countries. From
  this clustering, we plan on learning if clustered countries have a similar
  Covid-19 spread.
</p>

<h3>Pre-processing</h3>
<p>
  For pre-processing we will remove several features. Some features contain
  information already encoded in other features. For example, we have
  information on population, surface area, and population density. We can remove
  population density in this situation, as it is population/surface area. There
  are also variables we think will likely be irrelevant to our findings, such as
  forested area or number of endangered species, which we plan to remove.
  Lastly, our data is entirely numerical except for the region in which a
  country resides (e.g. southern asia) which we will represent using one-hot
  encoding.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
  We will use half the dataset to train the model, and then check for accuracy
  against the other half of the dataset on past data. We can also predict the
  future rate of COVID-19 spread and wait until the predicted date to compare
  the actual spread against our predicted value. Our goal is to be within 10% of
  the true value. For example, we can predict total COVID-19 cases for a certain
  country 1 week into the future, and then see what the true value is once that
  time comes.
</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to provide unbiased prediction of COVID-19 spread by using
  various parameters for a better understanding of how each country operates and
  to combat spread of COVID-19 based on the predicted trajectory.

<h2>Touchpoint 2: Midterm Report</h2>
<p>
  The goal for this touchpoint was to clean and pre-process our data, as well as
  perform unsupervised learning algorithms.
</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning and Pre-processing</h2>
<p>
  Our country dataset had many features, some of which were extraneous. In order
  to focus on relevant features, we removed the following columns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mobile-cellular subscriptions</li>
  <li>Individuals using the Internet</li>
  <li>Balance of payments, current account (millions US)</li>
  <li>Threatened species</li>
  <li>Forested Area</li>
  <li>CO2 emissions</li>
  <li>Seats held by women in national parliaments %</li>
  <li>Refugees and others of concern to UNHCR (in thousands)</li>
  <li>International migrant stock</li>
  <li>Labour force participation (female/male pop. %)</li>
  <li>Net Official Development Assist. received (% of GNI)</li>
  <li>Infant mortality rate</li>
  <li>International migrant stock</li>
  <li>Fertility rate</li>
  <li>Sex ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we had to deal with misformatted and missing data.</p>

<h3>Misformatted Data</h3>
<p>
  There were a few types of misformatted data in our initial country dataset.
  Each country had a region feature (ex: CentralAmerica or NorthernAfrica). To
  represent these features numerically instead of as a string, we one-hot
  encoded each country's region. We split each region name into an individual
  column, putting a 1 if the country was from that region (0 if not). The next
  type of misformatted data was columns with multiple data values separated by a
  "/". For example, "Pop. using improved drinking water (urban, rural %)" with a
  value like "45.1/27". We separated this type of data into two columns,
  delimiting at the "/".
</p>

<h3>Missing Data</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the dataset, there were many types of missing data. Examples
  include "...", "-99", "". There also were cells with "~0", "-~0.0", and "-~0".
  We replaced all the approximately 0 values with 0. Then, we filled in all the
  missing data values by using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. For our
  k-value, we decided on using the square root of the number of datapoints we
  had. At the end, we had a clean dataset with purely numerical values.
</p>

<h3>Final Touches</h3>
<p>
  Now that we had a clean country features dataset, we now had to merge it with
  a dataset containing Covid-19 data for countries. Our Covid-19 dataset
  contained the number of cases in a country on every day starting from the
  beginning of the year. Because countries had different dates of first reported
  infection, we reduced the data down into number of Covid-19 cases 5 days, 25
  days, and 50 days after first infection. Then, we added these 3 columns as
  features to our cleaned country dataset.
</p>

<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p>
  Our goal for unsupervised learning was to cluster our countries, both with and
  without the Covid-19 features added.
</p>
<h3>DBSCAN</h3>
<p>
  We performed the DBSCAN algorithm because we suspected there were strong
  outliers among the countries, for example the USA and China. Here is our
  results for performing DBSCAN on GDP and Population of countries.
</p>
<img
  src="img/dbscan_clusters_with_outliers.png"
  alt="dbscan_clusters_with_outliers"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<img
  src="img/dbscan_clusters_without_outliers.png"
  alt="dbscan_clusters_without_outliers"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<img
  src="img/dbscan-gdp-population-clusters.png"
  alt="dbscan-gdp-population-clusters"
  style="width: 30%"
/>

<p>
  As seen in the images, most of the countries are similar in terms of
  population and GDP, however there are a few outliers like the USA and China
  that are far removed from the majority of the others because they have much
  higher GDP and population. These outliers represent countries with a large GDP
  and population. The yellow cluster includes Ghana, Mozambique, Nepal, and
  Yemen. The green cluster includes Hong Kong, Denmark, Ireland, Israel, and
  Singapore. The majority of other countries are in the purple cluster.
</p>

<p>
  We also performed DBSCAN using the same eps parameter (0.04) and minValues
  parametr (4). This time, we taking into account all features of the countries
  along with the COVID cases. The results are below:
</p>

<img
  src="img/dbscan-all-features-outliers.png"
  alt="dbscan-all-features-outliers"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<img
  src="img/dbscan-all-features-no-outliers.png"
  alt="dbscan-all-features-no-outliers"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<img
  src="img/dbscan-all-features-clusters.png"
  alt="dbscan-all-features-clusters"
  style="width: 30%"
/>

<p>
  The clusters are extremely similar, indicating that GDP/Population are good
  measures of similarity between countries. The green cluster lost one country
  (Hong Kong). Overall, there were also less outliers (69 compared to 73).
</p>

<h3>K-Means Clustering</h3>
<p>
  We performed the kmeans algorithm on the dataset without the number of covid
  cases and with the number of covid cases after 5 days, 25 days, and 50 days.
  The first image is the clustering without covid cases and the second picture
  is with covid cases.
</p>
<img src="img/kmeans.png" alt="kmeans" style="width: 40%" />
<img src="img/kmeans_covid.png" alt="kmeans_covid" style="width: 40%" />

<p>
  We chose k-means clustering because it's a common clustering algorithm that we
  learned in class. We used the elbow method to determine the number of
  clusters, which is 9. For the clustering without covid cases, countries seems
  to be grouped in terms of either common region and/or gross domestic product.
  For cluster 0, countries such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand,
  Netherlands, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, United States, etc. This seems to
  be clustering "First World" countries with higher values in GDP and trading
  rates. For cluster 1, countries such as Saint Lucia, Bahamas, Dominican
  Republican, Turks and Caicos Islands, United States Virgin Islands, etc. This
  cluster seems to be grouping island countries located in the Carribean Sea.
  The rest of the clusters are grouped in respective to their GDP or to the
  regions that are closest to each other. As for clustering with covid cases,
  there were 2 clusters that did not have any changes. One of the cluster
  consists of countries located in the Carribean Sea and the other cluster
  consists of European countries located near the Mediterranean Sea. For the
  rest of the clusters, there is a 4-12 differences between the results from
  kmeans without covid versus with covid. Countries seems to be clustered
  geographically closer to countries near them. For example, Afghanistan,
  Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Bhutan were in the same cluster without covid cases,
  but were then put into clusters to countries that were closer to them with
  covid cases. Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia were in the same cluster as a
  handful of Southeast Asian countries without covid, but were grouped into
  clusters with South American countries with covid.
</p>

<h3>GMM</h3>
<!--TODO-->
<p>
  We then performed the GMM algorithm on the datasets with and without covid.
  The first step was to find how many components we should use to optimize our
  models. Shown below are two graphs displaying the AIC (Akaike information
  criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion). AIC is suggesting that we
  choose 12 components to get the best results. However, BIC is minimized at 3
  components. Since BIC is proposing a simpler model, that is what we went with.
</p>
<img src="img/AIC_BIC.png" alt="AIC_BIC" style="width: 40%" />
<img src="img/AIC_BIC_Covid.png" alt="AIC_BIC_Covid" style="width: 40%" />

<p>
  Next, we had to create the models and analyze the clusters. Our results are
  shown below. Evaluating the dataset without covid, we can see the clusters are
  computed by having similar features like GDP, surface area, population,
  international trade, etc. Since only 3 clusters were made, the data does vary
  with the PCA, but overall produced promising results. Now, interpreting the
  dataset with covid, we see a similar output. However, it is interesting to
  note that cluster 0 and cluster 2 have been switched. While accounting for
  covid, many countries which are closer together were now being grouped
  together. The covid data changed the PCA, enhancing the clusters and providing
  an improved model.

<img
  src="img/GMM_Clustering_Covid.png"
  alt="GMM_Clustering_Covid"
  style="width: 40%"
/>

<h3>K-Means vs. GMM</h3>
<p>
  We ran kmeans with 3 clusters and the countries in each cluster matches with
  the countries in each cluster from gmm, with a difference of 1-6 countries for
  each cluster. Kmeans is strictly based off distance of the clusters and gmm is
  based off of the gaussian distribution. Kmeans is a 'hard' assignment while
  gmm is a 'soft' assignment and because of this gmm is subjective to
  randomness, which affects the differences of 1-6 countries in each cluster.
</p>

<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>
  We made histograms of the 5 highest variance features in our dataset to get a
  better understanding of the distribution of our data.
</p>

<img
  src="img/RuralDrinkingWater5.png"
  alt="Rural Improved Drinking Water 5 Bins"
  style="width: 40%"
/>
This was our highest variance feature. A little over half of countries have
clean drinking water widely available in rural areas. However, the remainder of
the countries are relatively evenly distributed between 0 to 80 percent of the
population using improved drinking water. Access to sanitary water helps prevent
disease in general, and making sure it is clean would prevent an avenue COVID-19
has for spreading. However, being rural, it's also possible that the impact may
be lessened due to people being more distanced by nature. It will be interesting
to see how well this serves as a predictor for how covid spreads in a country.

<img
  src="img/UrbanDrinkingWater5.png"
  alt="Urban Improved Drinking Water 5 Bins"
  style="width: 40%"
/>

<p>
  This was our second highest variance feature. It follows a similar
  distribution to rural drinking water, although even more countries fall into
  the 80-100% bin. This makes sense, as countries with the infrastructures for
  clean rural drinking water are likely to have that in place in cities as well,
  and countries without the rural infrastructure may have it only in their
  cities. Lack of clean water in an urban environment is ikely even more of a
  problem than lack of clean water in a rural environment.
</p>
<img src="img/YoungAge5.png" alt="Under 14 5 bins" style="width: 40%" />

<p>
  This was our third highest variance feature. Although more countries tend to
  have a low percentage of people under 14, there are still a little over 20
  countries with between 42.5 and 50% and around 80 between 27.5 and 42.5.
  Countries with a larger amount of children may be at risk of COVID-19
  spreading faster as children may be less careful and interact with many people
  through school or other activities. However, it is also another way to
  contextualize cases as children are often less at risk of serious danger when
  contracting COVID-19.
</p>
<img
  src="img/Urban8.png"
  alt="Percent Population Urban 8 Bins"
  style="width: 40%"
/>

<p>
  This was our fourth highest variance feature. Very few countries exhibited
  extremely low urban population percentages, with around 140 countries sitting
  between 40% and 100% urban. That number drops for the bins of countries with a
  smaller percent. Urban locations can be COVID-19 hotspots as they are more
  likely destinations for travelers, and have a large number of people in close
  proximity, aiding in the spread of the disease and increase of casen numbers.
</p>

<img src="img/OldAge8.png" alt="Over 60 8 Bins" style="width: 40%" />
<p>
  This was our fifth highest variance feature. It follows similar distribution
  to the young age distribution. However, older people tend to be more at risk
  upon contracting COVID-19, and even places with lower case numbers may be more
  heavily affected if they have a larger elderly proportion
</p>

<img
  src="img/popdensity10.png"
  alt="Population Density 10 Bins"
  style="width: 40%"
/>
<img
  src="img/surfacearea10.png"
  alt="Surface Area 10 Bins"
  style="width: 40%"
/>
<p>
  This was a feature we thought would be interesting to consider, as countries
  with a higher population density would probably have COVID-19 spread more
  rapidly. We found that the majority of countries had very similar population
  densities, and the majority of countries were also comparably sized, although
  there were a few countries with much higher population density (Monaco, Macao)
  as well as a few extremely large countries (Australia, Brazil, China, USA,
  Canada, Russia)
</p>

<p>
  We also generated a Correlation Matrix to better understand how our features
  were related. The highly correlated variables (|r| > .5) were logical. For
  example male tertiary eduction rate and female tertiary education rate had an
  r = 0.925538 and countries with large populations tended to have larger total
  imports and exports (r = 0.605799 and r = 0.605799, respectively).
</p>

<p>The correlation matrix is provided at the bottom. It has been moved so you don't need to scroll through it to access supervised learning results(warning: it is very large)</p>


<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Touchpoint 3: Final Report</h2>
<p>
  The goal for this touchpoint was to perform supervised learning algorithms on
  our cleaned data in order to predict the number of covid cases in a country x
  days after first infection. We randomly split our data into 80% training data
  and 20% test data. We also used the same training and test data across our
  different algorithms so that we could compare results.
</p>

<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
<p>
  One method we chose was neural networks because it is a supervised learning
  method that allows us to predict a final value based off of features.
  Furthermore, we learned about them in class so we had a good foundation to
  branch off of. We used a neural network with the features being the 58
  different attributes of each country and the label being the number of covid
  cases after x number of days. We ran our model 3 separate times, where x
  varied between 5, 25, and 50.
</p>

<p>
  For the architecture of our neural network, we chose the ReLU activation
  function because ReLU models generally perform well and avoid certain pitfalls
  like the vanishing gradient problem. We initially ran our model with 2 hidden
  layers and 32 nodes at each layer, but our results weren’t very informative.
  So, we upped the number of hidden layers and nodes for our data, but this led
  to overfitting. To compensate for this, we applied regularization techniques
  to arrive at our final model. Graphs and results for each of these steps are
  shown below.
</p>

<p>
  We chose an optimization function of “adam” from keras, since it is widely
  used for regression in neural nets. We then chose mean squared error as our
  loss function because we were working with a regression model and not a
  classification one. We chose a linear activation for our output layer instead
  of other choices like sigmoid, since our regression problem required an
  unbounded function.
</p>

<h3>Results/Analysis</h3>
<p>
  These are our results and analysis from creating a neural network model and
  running our training data through it. This analysis includes data from China.
</p>

<h4>Day 5:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    For the 2 hidden layers/32 nodes a layer, we accrued a total loss of
    1,173,031.375, indicating that our model performed on the poorer side. The
    training ran for 100 epochs, and at each step our loss value decreases.
  </li>

    alt="img/NN/withChina/5-graph1"
    style="width: 50%"
  />
  <li>
    For the 5 hidden layers/1000 nodes a layer, which led to an overfitting of
    our data. We suffered a greater loss starting at 40,589,744 and with each
    epoch step, the loss did decrease linearly to 132,500.
  </li>
  <img
    src="img/NN/withChina/5-graph2.png"
    alt="img/NN/withChina/5-graph2"
    style="width: 50%"
  />
  <li>
    To account for the overfitting, we added regularization. We suffered from a
    greater loss at the start at 40,589,536, which decreased each epoch step
    until 177,400.9688.
  </li>
  <img
    src="img/NN/withChina/5-graph3.png"
    alt="img/NN/withChina/5-graph3"
    style="width: 50%"
  />
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  Our prediction output was hundreds times the actual number of cases for day 5.
  For example, Guyana had 5 cases, but our neural net predicted that there
  should be 918 cases for that day. Sudan had 1 case, but our neural net
  predicted there should be 864. Mauritania had 1 case, but our model predicted
  there should be 607 cases. The prediction is heavily skewed and does not
  accurately reflect the total number of cases for day 5.
</p>

<h4>Day 25:</h4>
<ul>
  <img
    src="img/NN/withChina/25-loss.png"

  <li>
    For the 2 hidden layers/32 nodes a layer, we accrued a total loss of
    1,964,524.5
  </li>
  <li>
    For the 5 hidden layers/1000 nodes a layer, we started with a loss of
    128,204,568 and decreased to 201,917.625.
  </li>
  <li>
    After accounting for overfitting, our losses were about the same as with
    overfitting the data in part b) above.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  Our prediction was off for day 25 covid cases. While Guyana, Sudan, and
  Mauritania’s cases grew proportionally in both the predictions and the actual
  data since day 5, the United Kingdom had 15,025 cases on day 25, but our model
  predicted that it should be 1485.
</p>

<h4>Day 50:</h4>
<ul>

  <li>
    For the 2 hidden layers/32 nodes a layer, we accrued a total loss of
    390,577.0312.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the 5 hidden layers/1000 nodes a layer, we started with a loss of
    4,230,824,704 and decreased to 11,1263,208.
  </li>
  <li>
    After accounting for overfitting, our losses were about the same as with
    overfitting the data in part b) above.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  Our prediction was more inaccurate compared to day 50 because cases were on
  the rise for day 50, but our prediction model seemed to predict half of the
  number of cases since day 25. For example, Guyana is predicted to have 535,
  Sudan was supposed to have 554, and Mauritania should have 503 cases.
</p>

<h3>Re-evaluating our Model</h3>
<p>
  Once we obtained these results, we re-evaluated our model to look for
  improvements. When looking back at our training data, we realized that one
  huge outlier was China. While most countries only had a few dozen covid cases
  at Day 5, China had over 80,000. We suspected that this huge number in China
  biased our model. Thus, we re-ran our model after removing China from our
  training set.
</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  Our prediction was the most accurate for day 5 without China’s data as part of
  the training set. Guyana had 5 cases, but should have 21, Sudan had 1, but
  should have 3, the United Kingdom had 220, but should have 229, and Mauritania
  had 1, but should have -15. Overall, the prediction was pretty close to the
  actual cases of day 5.

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  Our prediction for day 25 was inaccurate as the predicted number of cases were
  much greater than the actual number of cases. Guyana had 37, but should be
  1171, Sudan had 12, but should have 594, and the United Kingdom had 15,025,
  but should have 5783.54. Some countries, such as France and Germany had covid
  cases in the range of 80,000, which could be the outlier that influenced our
  model’s prediction to skew the cases higher than the actual number of cases.

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>
  The prediction of cases for day 50 grew proportionally to the number of cases
  for day 25. For example, Guyana had 82, but should have 6420, Sugan had 442,
  but should have 3163, and the United Kingdom had 121,412, but should have
  16,688. The prediction was still inaccurate, but that could be due to the
  outliers such as France, Germany, and Italy for our training set.
</p>

<h3>Overall Analysis</h3>
<p>
  Overall, our neural network performed poorly (except for day 5’s prediction
  without China’s data) and this could be due to our poor training data. Our
  predictions for covid cases including China’s were the most inaccurate. The
  predicted number cases were in the hundreds and thousands, all relatively
  close to one another. However, the actual number of cases were not as
  uniformed. Some countries only had a handful, while others had thousands of
  cases. As for our data without China’s data, we suspected that since a handful
  of countries have outliers with cases in the range of 80,000-100,000, while
  most countries only hand a few thousands, this could be the reason why our
  neural network also performed poorly. Countries such as France, Germany, and
  Italy experienced a spike in covid cases, and as a result, countries that
  share similar characteristics to those countries were expected to have the
  same number of cases. The outliers also overpredicted for the rest of the
  countries, a similar trends that we saw when we included China’s data in our
  training sets.

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
<!-- TODO: Finish -->

<h2>Decision Trees</h2>
<p> due to the poor performance of our regression analysis, we attempted to resturcture our problem as a classification task</p>
<img
  src="img/bins_histogram_unmodified.png"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<p>Our original distribution of cases numbers was very heavily focused in one group, with a few outliers. This is due to cases being a total number, rather than proportional to the population </p>
<img
  src="img/bins_histogram_scaled.png"
  style="width: 30%"
/>

<p>When scaled to our population, we see a bigger spread, but still have a few outliers</p>

  <img
    src="img/bins_histogram.png"
    style="width: 30%"
  />
<p>Our distribution looks like the above when the outliers are removed. So we settled on the bins <=20, (20, 100], (100, 200], >200. </p>


<img
  src="img/DecisionTree.png"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<p>The confusion matrix and classification report are above. Since we do not have a strong preference for precision or recall, we mainly looked at our F1 score. It has an accuracy of .63 overall, but the macro average is .4 and the weight average is .6. Overall, there are many countries in group 1, which we classified well, but it became much more difficult for other groups</p>

<img
  src="img/DecisionTree_diagram.png"
  style="width: 30%"
/>
<p>The decision tree is pictured above. Clearly, one of the most informative features was the population size (x[1]) and the rural clean drinking water percentage (x[26]). Both of these make sense as they directly impact the spread of disease. Given the nature of our data, a lot of the information can be hard to collect, especially for less developed coutnries, where there is no infrastructure to gather those statistics. Even in countries with the resources to do so, testing for coronavirus may not be a social norm. This may help explain the difficulty our model had in properly predicting cases</p>
