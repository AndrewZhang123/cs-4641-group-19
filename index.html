<p>Predicting COVID-19 Spread Based on Country’s Metrics</p>

<h3>Introduction/Background</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to understand how effective the different characteristics of
  countries around the world (e.g.total population, population density, GDP)
  affect the rate at which COVID-19 spreads around the corresponding country.
  Some models rely on user’s inputs such as local population, current status of
  infection, while others focus more on data reported by the World Health
  Organization and their government. In addition, there seems to be a lack of
  information around the handling of coronavirus. It is easy to say a certain
  place’s government handled coronavirus well because the cases are low, and
  another’s handled it poorly due to the high rate of infection. However, this
  approach lacks context, failing to take into account the differences in
  countries.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
  We are analyzing unique combinations of features of countries to approach this
  problem. We will also try multiple machine learning approaches and see what is
  most effective. We think this will be successful because we can be flexible in
  our model choice and the country features we choose to analyze. We will
  preprocess the data in order to remove duplicate columns.For example, we have
  information on surface area, population, and population density. Population
  density is just population / surface area, and is thus redundant information.
  Potential methods we want to test out include linear regression, LDA, and
  decision trees. There are concerns about the accuracy of data regarding the
  spread of COVID, with certain countries underreporting or undertesting, which
  could have implications on the data of our model. Therefore, if we are not
  clear about the potential limitations of our model, we run the risk of
  spreading misinformation. (check with TA about this idk what they’re looking
  for). We will be using free libraries and methods to perform our analysis. So,
  it will not cost anything. Depending on the method we use to analyze, the time
  will vary.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
  We will use half the dataset to train the model, and then check for accuracy
  against the other half of the dataset on past data. We can also predict the
  future rate of COVID-19 spread and wait until the predicted date to compare
  the actual spread against our predicted value.
</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
  We are trying to provide unbiased prediction of COVID-19 spread by using
  various parameters for a better understanding of how each country operates and
  to combat spread of COVID-19 based on the predicted trajectory.
